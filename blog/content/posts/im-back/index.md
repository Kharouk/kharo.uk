So, I am back. It wasn't too tough. I had to fight some inner demons, decide what conversations were worth to have in my head, and commit some serious hours in a job that I'm having a tough time dealing with. But, I'm back, and I'm ready for round two.

I've been trying to combat myself. I want to learn `C++`, or fundamentals of JavaScript again, or what the hell functional programming means in the basic of gists. But what I am realizing now, is that everything interests me. It would be disappointing if I just stuck to one topic, like **Machine Learning** or **Higher Order Functions** (even though I think this is very important.)

So I hope this blog post is a warning sign to my procrastinated side. A subtle fuck you to my inner bodies not showing/nor giving the work necessary to stay afloat in this dangerous field we note as Web Development.
